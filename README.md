about me:<br/>
name :G.Rithvik Rao<br/>
roll no:220102035<br/>
branch: ECE<br/>
codechef username:rithvik_rao<br/>
about me:I am just a normal guy who entered into iit without knowing much about coding.<br/>
but my every interaction with coding whether it is cp or webd or opensource making me even more curious to move forward<br/>
why I want to contribute:
well at first I thought open source as some boring thing.<br/>
but as I learned more about it ,I was really impressed about the version control and how it helps in various development tasks<br/>
i want to contribute to open source because it makes coding more acessible and more fun for people along the world.<br/>
